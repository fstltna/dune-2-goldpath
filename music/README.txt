Music loading instructions
--------------------------
The two subfolders that include "Add your own" in the names are primary music folders.  Do not change the name of these folders.

During normaly gameplay, music files will be randomly chosen from the Ambient folder, and played in the background of the game.  While units are in combat, files from the Combat folder will be used instead.

Inside these folders, you may place your own OGG or FLAC music files to include in the randomly selected soundtrack of the game.  There is currently no way to manually select a track, so you may not hear your own tracks for some time.
